arena-bound wave-based arcadey roguelite game
score points based on certain actions
	collecting items/collectibles and killing creatures gain you points
	collection combo: collect flowers/fruit consecutively for a points multiplier
	killing combo: kill creatures consecutively for a points multiplier
	points are related to multiplayer leaderboards (high scores) and ingame shops
	better items will cost more points and better items are more common in later stages
map is decently sized, allowing for verious random world events and maybe even structures/rooms?
high ground / low ground system?
meta progression: unlock new items and playable characters as you win runs
multiplayer: leaderboards (maybe seeded runs)


each stage is handled in phases.
	phase 1 (day?) (probably 7 minutes duration)
		neutral creatures spawn, eating resources around the map and becoming more powerful
		helpful items can be earned by completing world events, sapping flowers, or by killing powerful creatures
		also, collect flowers/fruit for extra points
		getting more points during this phase means more chances for generating interesting items later on
		if there are structures on the map, include rooms with difficult creatures but good loots inside
	phase 2 (night?)
		waves of evil/hostile creatures spawn
		after this phase, gain more powerful rewards
		more points are awarded based on how fast this phase is completed
	post-stage interdimensional shop
		upgrade, buy/sell items <-> points
		(might be too crazy) CREATE unique items with special names/lore whlie hand picking ability traits for the item
			instead of hand-picking traits directly, maybe a bunch of items could be dropped into a sieve to create a new item
after the end of the stage, certain features on the map change, like tree/plant locations, terrain, or structures
	additionally, flowers are replenished on the map
every three stages there is a boss fight at the end of phase 2.


----% map concepts and features %----
traps, wells/fountains/springs, non-traversable terrain (pits, lava, etc), destructible terrain (boulders, gravel)
jungle-style plants/trees which produce fruit based on certain conditions
events like rainstorm, flash flood, wildfire, or rapid growth could happen periodically
possible structures
	minitemple could include treasure rooms
	castle could have simple villagers and guards, castle could have stocks of food and valuables
	sewer system miniboss being defeated could cause a sewer failure flood, creating more plants around the map
	booster pads could randomly fling creatures/enemies about
bury an item in the ground to have it grow into something later?
	perhaps items could be shared between runs OR special items could appear in other people's runs

----% creature concepts %-----
most creatures are out to eat, becoming more powerful (more threatening) (if they become powerful enough, do they become evil?)
some creatures can be befriended by doing a miniquest (?)
MOST CREATURES SHOULD HAVE SIMPLE ACTIONS WHICH ALLOW FOR EMERGENT BEHAVIORS

reward players who feed neutral creatures:
	neutral creatures who are fed more will drop more powerful things
	maybe neutral creatures will become hostile at a certain food level

neutral creatures will hide (?) at the start of phase 2
	they will persist in the world between stages

bromeliad (static plant)
	unmoving plant which generates fruits at a consistent rate
	plant can be pollinated to accelerate the generation

drone (organic)
	simple behavior
	sightline 20 units
	search for fruits/plants when hungry
	wander when not hungry
	attack when next to a creature

shark (organic)
	sightline 20 units
	carnivorous; will seek out creatures to fight and eat when hungry
	wander when not hungry
	attack when next to a creature
	moves faster than drone

sloth (organic)
	sightline 40 units
	will grab fruit and carry it elsewhere to eat it slowly
	wander when not hungry
	passive normally
	moves slower than a drone

honnon (organic)
	befriend this creature to convince it to pollinate flowers faster (spawning more fruit)
	will always run away from other species unless specifically allied

krusha (construct)
	rolls along the ground, sometimes creating non-traversable terrain

moth (organic)
	fast chaotic entity, shoots dust pellets

lakkit (organic)
	brings fruit to nest to feed its babies
	3 fruits will grow another lakkit

monkey (organic)
	can jump long distances
	kills creatures for food

jellyfish (organic)
	shoots bubbles (when enemies in range)

force field (construct)
	create barriers

----% tentative outline %----
ensure that main.lua is incredibly simple to read; no non-essential functions or code should be here
focus on core gameplay loop first:
	phase 1
		gather items, interact with neutral creatures, and get more powerful
	phase 2
		survive waves of evil enemies for a reward at the end
	shop
		buy items/artifacts using points earned from phase 1 and 2

don't get stuck on making things look cool, that can always be mended later!!
focus on solid gameplay rather than aesthetic, especially early on.
