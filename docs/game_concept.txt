---------& arena shooter game &----------

survive as long as you can under an onslaught of feral beasts
	enemies will spawn semi-randomly, with harder ones spawning later on in the game
	maps will be a certain size

camera will be fixed to the player so that they can aim using mouse without trouble

game loop:
	[live]
	choose a starting item
		collect coins which spawn around the map for points
		beasts will emerge from portals
		kill beasts
		get item
		(event)?
		kill boss
		advance to next map
	[die]

game aesthetic?
