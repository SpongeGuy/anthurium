possible titles [Gwydion] [Anthurium] [Bromeliad]

arena-bound wave-based arcadey roguelite game
score points based on certain actions
	collecting items/collectibles and killing creatures gain you points
	collection combo: collect flowers/fruit consecutively for a points multiplier
	killing combo: kill creatures consecutively for a points multiplier
	points are related to multiplayer leaderboards (high scores) and ingame shops
map is decently sized, allowing for verious random world events and maybe even structures/rooms?
high ground / low ground system?
meta progression: unlock new items and playable characters as you win runs
multiplayer: leaderboards (maybe seeded runs)


each stage is handled in phases.
	phase 1
		neutral creatures spawn, eating resources around the map and becoming more powerful
		helpful items can be earned by completing world events, sapping flowers, or by killing powerful creatures
		also, collect flowers/fruit for extra points
		getting more points during this phase means more chances for generating interesting items later on
		if there are structures on the map, include rooms with difficult creatures but good loots inside
	phase 2
		waves of evil/hostile creatures spawn
		after this phase, gain more powerful rewards
		more points are awarded based on how fast this phase is completed
	post-stage interdimensional shop
		upgrade, buy/sell items <-> points
		(might be too crazy) CREATE unique items with special names/lore whlie hand picking ability traits for the item
			instead of hand-picking traits directly, maybe a bunch of items could be dropped into a pot to create a new item
after the end of the stage, certain features on the map change, like tree/plant locations
	additionally, flowers are replenished on the map
every three stages there is a boss fight at the end of phase 2.


----% map concepts and features %----
traps, wells/fountains/springs, non-traversable terrain (pits, lava, etc), destructible terrain (boulders, gravel)
jungle-style plants/trees which produce fruit based on certain conditions
events like rainstorm, flash flood, wildfire, or rapid growth could happen periodically
possible structures
	minitemple could include treasure rooms
	castle could have simple villagers and guards, castle could have stocks of food and valuables
	sewer system miniboss being defeated could cause a sewer failure flood, creating more plants around the map
	booster pads could randomly fling creatures/enemies about
bury an item in the ground to have it grow into something later?
	perhaps items could be shared between runs OR special items could appear in other people's runs


----% neutral creature ideas %-----
most creatures are out to eat, becoming more powerful (more threatening) (if they become powerful enough, do they become evil?)
some creatures can be befriended by doing a miniquest (?)

honnon (organic)
	befriend this creature to convince it to pollinate flowers faster (spawning more fruit)
	will always run away from other species unless specifically allied

krusha (construct)

moth (organic)
	fast chaotic entity, shoots dust pellets

lakkit (organic)

	3 fruits will grow another lakkit
